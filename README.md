# OCI Image Supported Platforms

Get the OCI Platforms for a given OCI Image or Dockerfile

## Inputs

This action supports the following input.

### dockerfile

The Dockerfile to get its supported platforms

* *Required*: `No`
* *Type*: `string`
* *Default*: `Dockerfile`
* *Example*: `Dockerfile-alpine-zts`

### image

Passing anything into the `image` input will disable checking for the passed `dockerfile` input value, and will get the 
platforms for the image(s) you give it. When you pass it two or more, for example `ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:2024.12.2,ghcr.io/wyrihaximusnet/php:8.3-zts-alpine-dev`, 
it will get the platforms for all of them but only return the platforms that are supported by all of them.

* *Required*: `No`
* *Type*: `string`
* *Default*: ``
* *Example*: `ghcr.io/wyrihaximusnet/php:8.3-zts-alpine-slim`

## Output

This action only outputs a list of platforms as JSON through `platform`, and as CSV `platform_csv`.

For example when the found platforms are `linux/arm64` and `linux/amd64` the outputs are the following:
* `plarform`: `["linux/arm64","linux/amd64"]`
* `platform_csv`: `linux/arm64,linux/amd64`

## Building Example

The following example build a docker image for each upstream platform:

```yaml
jobs:
  supported-arch-matrix:
    outputs:
      platform: ${{ steps.supported-arch-matrix.outputs.platform }}
    steps:
      # Note: No checkout needed, the action will handle that for you in the most optimized way possible
      - id: supported-arch-matrix
        name: Generate Arch
        uses: wyrihaximus/github-action-oci-image-supported-platforms@v1
  build-docker-image:
    name: Build ${{ matrix.platform }} image
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        platform: ${{ fromJson(needs.supported-arch-matrix.outputs.platform) }}
    needs:
      - supported-arch-matrix
    steps:
      - name: Prepare
        run: |
          platform=${{ matrix.platform }}
          echo "PLATFORM_PAIR=${platform//\//-}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: docker image build --platform=${{ matrix.platform }} -t "ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:sha-abc123-${{ env.PLATFORM_PAIR }}" --no-cache .
```

For more details on how to take it from there, please have a look at [this blog post](https://blog.wyrihaximus.net/2024/10/building-secure-images-with-github-actions/).

## Retagging Example

The following example build a docker image for each upstream platform:

```yaml
jobs:
  oci-retag:
    steps:
      - name: Prepare Dockerfile
        run: |
          echo "ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:sha-abc123" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
          printf "FROM %s" $(echo "ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:sha-abc123" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]') >> Dockerfile.tag
          cat Dockerfile.tag
      - name: Detect Platform Flag
        id: platform
        uses: wyrihaximus/github-action-oci-image-supported-platforms@v1
        with:
          image: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:sha-abc123
      - name: Pull, retag, and push image
        run: |
          docker build --platform=${{ steps.platform.outputs.platform_csv }} --output=type=registry --no-cache -f Dockerfile.tag -t $(echo "ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:r123" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]') .
```
